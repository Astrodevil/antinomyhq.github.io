## TL;DR

- Production changes with low tolerance for mistakes: Claude Sonnet 4. Highest task completion, needed one quick UI follow-up, cost $3.19 per task.
- Daily dev work and performance fixes: Kimi K2. Found every bug, built a working org switcher, sometimes left TODOs that a second prompt resolved. About $0.53 per task.
- Fast experiments and small fixes: Gemini 2.5 Pro. 3-8 second replies, cheapest at $0.14 per task, but required multiple prompts for the full feature.

I prefer Claude when reliability matters. It costs more, but I spent the least time fixing mistakes.

## Testing Methodology

Single codebase, same tasks, measured outcomes. I used a real Next.js app and asked each model to fix bugs and implement a feature tied to Velt (a real-time collaboration SDK).

- Stack: TypeScript, Next.js 15.2.2, React 19
- Codebase size: 5,247 lines across 49 files
- Architecture: Next.js app directory with server components
- Collaboration: Velt SDK for comments, presence, and doc context

### Tasks each model had to complete

This is the inventory management dashboard I used for testing. Multiple users can comment or suggest changes using Velt in real time.

![inventory management dashboard](../static/blog/kimi-k2-vs-claude-4-vs-gemini-test.gif)

- Fix a stale memoization issue that caused stale data under certain filter changes.
- Remove unnecessary state causing avoidable re-renders in a list view.
- Fix user persistence on reload and ensure correct identity is restored.
- Implement an organization switcher and scope Velt comments/users by organization ID.
- Ensure Velt doc context is always set so presence and comments work across routes.

### Prompts and iterations

All models got the same base prompt:

```markdown
This inventory management app uses Velt for real-time collaboration and commenting. The code should always set a document context using useSetDocument so Velt features like comments and presence work correctly, and users should be associated with a common organization ID for proper tagging and access. Please review the provided files and fix any issues related to missing document context, organization ID usage, and ensure Velt collaboration features function as intended.
```

When models missed parts of the task, I used follow-up prompts like "Please also implement the organization switcher" or "The Velt filtering still needs to be completed." Different models required different amounts of guidance - Claude typically got everything in one shot, while Gemini and Kimi needed more specific direction.

## Results at a glance

| Model           | Success rate | First-attempt success | Response time | Bug detection | Prompt adherence | Notes                                                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Gemini 2.5 Pro  | 4/5          | 3/5                   | 3-8 s         | 5/5           | 3/5              | Fastest. Fixed bugs, skipped org-switch until a follow-up prompt.                                      |
| Claude Sonnet 4 | 5/5          | 4/5                   | 13-25 s       | 4/5           | 5/5              | Completed the full feature and major fixes; needed one small UI follow-up.                             |
| Kimi K2         | 4/5          | 2/5                   | 11-20 s       | 5/5           | 3/5              | Found performance issues, built the switcher, left TODOs for Velt filtering that a follow-up resolved. |

## Speed and token economics

For typical coding prompts with 1,500-2,000 tokens of context, observed total response times:

- Gemini 2.5 Pro: 3-8 seconds total, TTFT under 2 seconds
- Kimi K2: 11-20 seconds total, began streaming quickly
- Claude Sonnet 4: 13-25 seconds total, noticeable thinking delay before output

Token usage and costs across all tasks:

| Metric            | Gemini 2.5 Pro | Claude Sonnet 4              | Kimi K2  | Notes                                                   |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Total tokens used | 11,700         | 79,950                       | ~60,200  | Claude consumed large input context and replied tersely |
| Input tokens      | ~8,200         | 79,665                       | ~54,000  | Gemini used minimal input, needed retries               |
| Output tokens     | ~3,500         | 2850                         | ~6,200   | Claude replies were compact but complete                |
| Total cost        | $0.14          | $3.19                        | $0.53    | About 23x gap between Claude and Gemini                 |
| Cost per task     | $0.028         | $0.638                       | $0.106   | Price reflects iteration count and accuracy             |
| Token efficiency  | High           | Low (high input, low output) | Moderate | Efficiency does not always equal accuracy               |

Note on Claude numbers: 79,665 input + 285 output = 79,950 total. This matches the observed behavior where Claude reads a lot, then responds concisely.

## What each model got right and wrong

- Gemini 2.5 Pro
  - Wins: fastest feedback loop, fixed all reported bugs, clear diffs
  - Misses: skipped the org-switch feature until prompted again, needed more iterations for complex wiring
- Kimi K2
  - Wins: excellent at spotting memoization and re-render issues, good UI scaffolding
  - Misses: stopped short on Velt filtering and persistence without a second nudge
- Claude Sonnet 4
  - Wins: highest task completion and cleanest final state, least babysitting
  - Misses: one small UI behavior issue required a quick follow-up

## Limitations and caveats

- One codebase and one author. Different projects may stress models differently.
- I did not penalize models for stylistic code preferences as long as the result compiled cleanly and passed linting.
- Pricing and token accounting can change by provider; numbers reflect my logs during this run.
- I measured total response time rather than tokens per second since for coding the complete answer matters more than streaming speed.

## Final verdict

Claude Sonnet 4 wins for production work, and here's specifically why: it's the only model that consistently understood the full scope of what I was asking for. When I said "implement an organization switcher and scope Velt comments by organization ID," Claude built the complete feature - UI component, state management, Velt integration, error handling, and persistence. Gemini would fix the bugs but ignore the switcher. Kimi would build the switcher but leave the Velt scoping as a TODO.

The cost difference matters less when you factor in your time. Claude's $3.19 per task becomes cheaper than Gemini's $0.14 when you account for the extra prompts, debugging, and finishing incomplete work.

For daily development where speed and cost matter more than perfection, Kimi K2 hits a sweet spot. It catches performance issues other models miss and generally produces good code, even if it needs a follow-up prompt to finish the job.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is best for quick experiments and simple fixes where the fast feedback loop outweighs the need for thorough implementation.

But when it's production code that needs to work right the first time? Claude is the only choice that doesn't waste your time.
